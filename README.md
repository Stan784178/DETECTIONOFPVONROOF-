# Solar Panel Detection from Images

## Purpose

This module demonstrates a **step-by-step workflow to detect solar panels in images**
using a **pre-trained object detection model**.

All steps are implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook:
**`solar detection.ipynb`**.

The goal is to:
- Load a detection model
- Apply it to input images
- Visualize detected solar panels using bounding boxes
